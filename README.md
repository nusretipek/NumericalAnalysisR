## Purpose

There are many different numerical analysis algorithms; root-finding and optimized non-linear solvers are important components of the mathematical analysis. The R scripts implement some of these theoretical approaches to illustrate step by step iteration procedure. Although these algorithms are implemented in some R packages already, they yield the converged result. For educational purposes, it is useful to observe what happens behind the scenes and decompose some elements in the scripts.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. False Position Method (Regula Falsi)
2. Fixed Point Iteration Method
3. Bisection Method
4. Newton-Raphson Method
5. LU Decomposition
